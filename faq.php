<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Why are my teeth sensitive?</h3>
<p>Sensitive teeth often come from the fact that your gums have slightly receded. This recession of the gum line allows the underlying dentin to show through which allows water and food easier access to the sensitive nerve. To manage this, there are a number of toothpastes, gels and even some dental procedures that can be applied. Speak to us in more detail if you have very sensitive teeth.

<h3>What is Periodontal Disease?</h3>
<p>Periodontal Disease is a quiet disease that begins with little or no symptoms. It is caused by bacteria that surrounds the teeth and enters the gums. The immediate condition is known as ‘gingivitis’. The gums become irritated, inflamed and often bleed. If not properly treated, the condition worsens.  Noticeable symptoms now appear. They include:
</p>

    	<li>Bad Breath</li>
        <li>Gum Recession</li>

<h3>What is the Difference Between a White Filling and a Silver Filling?</h3>
<p>Silver Fillings known as Amalgam have been around for decades. Made from a metal alloy, it was the best restoration for fillings. The metal expands and contracts with the heat and cold placed in the mouth. This allowed for little bacteria to enter a tooth once filled; keeping the tooth healthy and strong.
</p>
<p>White Fillings, also known as composites are often made of plastic or glass polymers. These cosmetic fillings allow us to fill a cavity with a substance that will look and feel just like your existing tooth structure. This restoration is created with a resin material and fits tightly into a tooth to prevent decay. Rather than a gray or silver material in your mouth, the composite color will match the tooth color.

<h3>What is a Dental Implant?</h3>
<p>A Dental Implant is a “man-made” replacement for a missing tooth or tooth root. Made from titanium, this screw-like object is inserted under the gum and directly into the upper or lower jaw bone. There is usually minimal discomfort involved with this procedure.  After a period of a few months, the Dental Implant and the bone fuse together. This creates an anchor for the new tooth to be placed onto the dental implant.
</p>

    </ul>

<h3>Who is a candidate for Dental Implants?</h3>

</p>

<p>The next visit is to place the Implant. A local anesthesia is applied to the area. Any additional sedation is no longer necessary unless deemed by the dentist. The dentist will then make a minor incision to place the implant. The implant is placed into the jaw bone. The area will then be covered with sutures. The procedure is usually completed with minor pain.
</p>

<p>You will next return in approximately 3 months to begin creating the Porcelain Crown to place over the Implant.
</p>
